Python-based example demonstrating the process of analyzing and classifying text data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in a big data context, leveraging Spark NLP and Apache Spark. Initially, the script sets up the environment for Spark NLP using a bash command, ensuring all necessary dependencies and libraries are available for running Spark NLP.


The script begins by loading a CSV file named `annotated-titles.csv` into a pandas DataFrame, which probably contains text data along with annotations. It displays the first few rows of this DataFrame and undertakes some basic data preprocessing, including filtering the DataFrame based on specific values in the 'label' column, selecting particular columns for analysis, and standardizing label values.


Following the data preparation, a Spark session is initialized to harness Apache Spark's capabilities for processing large datasets. The data is then read into a Spark DataFrame, and several transformations are applied, such as grouping and counting data by labels, casting the label column to an integer type, and filtering the dataset based on label values.


The script explores two different approaches for text classification using machine learning models. The first approach employs logistic regression, where the text data is transformed using the Universal Sentence Encoder to generate embeddings that serve as features. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the logistic regression model is trained and evaluated on these sets, with performance metrics like the classification report and accuracy score being printed.


In the second approach, a deep learning classifier, ClassifierDL (Classifier Deep Learning), is utilized. This method also uses the Universal Sentence Encoder for text embedding. A ClassifierDL model is trained on the dataset and evaluated, similar to the logistic regression method.


Additionally, the script demonstrates the downsampling of the dataset to balance the classes and trains a new ClassifierDL model on this downsampled data. The performance of this model is then evaluated, showcasing the script's comprehensive capabilities in processing and classifying text data. It highlights data preprocessing, feature extraction with embeddings, model training and evaluation, and handling class imbalance, all integrated within the Spark NLP framework. The script effectively illustrates the use of both traditional machine learning (logistic regression) and deep learning (ClassifierDL) for text classification in a big data environment.
